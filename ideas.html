<h2>Fashion Business Ideas</h2>
<h3>So, how do you turn your love-affair for fashion into a successful business? Here’s 50 small business ideas to inspire fashionistas</h3>

<h2>Make Fabulous Belts</h2>
<h3>Being a unisex item, belts will always be in high demand. Get your foot into the fashion industry by manufacturing and marketing belts.</h3>

<h2>Start Selling Clothes On eBay</h2>
<h3>Or, like Amoruso, why not initiate a fashion venture by selling clothes and other fashion items on eBay? Second-hand vintage clothes can go down well on eBay. Start by sorting out your own wardrobe and selling what you don’t want on eBay.</h3>

<h2>Start a Shoe Line</h2>
<h3>If there’s one thing we can’t get enough off, it’s shopping for shoes! As the world can’t get enough of shoe shopping you could certainly do a lot worse than starting your own shoe manufacturing business.</h3>
